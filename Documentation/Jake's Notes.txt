This is just a kind of a scratch pad for me so that it is always up to date and stay with the project. - Jake

Sawyer's notes on the hero's movement (saved for later use)

			this.drag.x = 640;
			this.acceleration.y = 800;//Got it just about how fast real gravity is, seems good. -Sawyer
			this.maxVelocity.x = 150;//A value of 64 seems to be synched with the distance traveled. -Sawyer
			this.maxVelocity.y = 10000000;//A low max velocity makes things floaty i.e. terminal velocity. Considering the
											//size of our maps terminal velocity should never be reached. -Sawyer
											
											
				y -= 1;
				velocity.y = -400;//Through testing I have determined that velocity increases by 12.8 every frame
			}					//Coincidentally, this is the vertical resolution divided by framerate. -Sawyer
								//Jump height is determined by a relationship between this value and acceleration.
								//Currenly the height is slightly over three blocks. -Sawyer
